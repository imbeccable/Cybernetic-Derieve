# Cybernetic-Derieve
ART 151 mini-project 2.

The basic path I wanted to follow was the growth and mutation of meme culture.
I've been on the internet since I was about 12 or 13 and have seen how memes started
and how they've ended up. Comparing a meme from 2012 to one from 2019 is almost surreal.
Those genres of memes only have a seven year gap between them but the overall vibe of 
either genre is completely different. Online humour has shifted and mutated so much over
the last decade and it's very interesting to me.
