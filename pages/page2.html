                Despite being a puppet, Kermit looks sarcastic as he's 
                <br>drinking his tea. And the whole "but that's none
                <br>of my business" part is so simple and clear.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                ... Now that I think about it, I wonder if this was the 
                <br>origin of the phrase "spill the tea, sis" 
                <br>vernacular that arose a couple years back. Hm.</br>
